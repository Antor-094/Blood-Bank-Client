# Blood Bank Website - MERN Stack Project

## Project Overview

The Blood Bank Website project aims to create a user-friendly and efficient web application to facilitate blood donation and distribution processes. The website will allow donors, organizations, and hospitals to register and interact with the platform, making it easier to manage blood donations, requests, and distributions. The project will utilize the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) along with Tailwind CSS and Ant Design for frontend development and Redux/Redux Toolkit for state management.

## Project Objectives

1. Develop a web application that connects blood donors, organizations, and hospitals.
2. Create separate login and registration screens for each category of users.
3. Implement a secure and efficient authentication system for user access.
4. Enable donors to view their donation records and the list of hospitals/organizations they have donated to along with the donated quantity.
5. Allow organizations to collect blood from donors and supply it to hospitals based on requirements.
6. Provide extensive modules and functionalities for organization users, including dashboard, analytics, and filters.
7. Enable hospitals to view their blood consumption from different organizations with detailed information.
8. Implement complex MongoDB queries like aggregation and grouping for efficient data handling.

## Technologies Used

1. MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for full-stack development.
2. Tailwind CSS and Ant Design for frontend design and layout.
3. Redux and Redux Toolkit for state management.
4. MongoDB for the database, handling document-oriented data.
5. Node.js and Express for building the backend server.
6. React for developing the client-side user interface.

## Project Scope

1. Designing and implementing the database structure using MongoDB, incorporating necessary data models for donors, organizations, hospitals, and blood donation records.
2. Building the backend server using Node.js and Express, handling user authentication, blood donation, and distribution processes.
3. Creating separate frontend interfaces for donors, organizations, and hospitals using React and implementing login and registration screens.
4. Implementing Redux and Redux Toolkit for state management and handling data flows throughout the application.
5. Developing functionalities for donors to view their donation history and organizations to manage blood collection and distribution.
6. Creating advanced modules and dashboard for organization users, incorporating analytics and filters for efficient blood management.
7. Allowing hospitals to access their blood consumption details from different organizations.
8. Implementing QA support and ensuring the application's stability and security.
9. Providing code access and documentation for future maintenance and enhancements.
